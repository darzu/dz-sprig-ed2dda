create mesh, 

#1:
  each joint has an orientation, 
  each vertice is assigned to a joint

#2:
  plan a whole path for the vertices
  write the whole animation, plus a time component

#3:
  bezier curve

simple start:
  one line, two end points, you just control the position of those two points
  noodle renderer has a uniform that places the two end points
  endpoints are always the same orientation (for now)
