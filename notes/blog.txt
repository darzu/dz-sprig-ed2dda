        web IDE
        easy dependencies
    
    What do the URLs look like?
        static serve from github pages
        so a project is a self-contained folder
        so to create a project, take an entry point and tree shake off everything else

    Build step:
        From entry point .ts file
            which has a standard attachToCanvas() function
        traverse imports
        collect files to be coppied
        create a readme.md
        tree shake off unused .ts ?
        copy to blog/ folder
