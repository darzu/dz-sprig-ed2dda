Robolox style, standard "knight" animations:
    Run, Walk, Jump, Idle, Fall, Swim, Climb
    supports multiple animations per category, indicating (weighted) variation

Skinned vs not:
    Skinned introduces new vertices (I think)
        Mixamo introduces lots of new triangles

Rigid animation:
    Seperate meshes, childed, placed with offsets
        Also works well for body animations like a rock golum
    Single vertex buffer, just stretched
